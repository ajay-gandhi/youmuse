> Play music from YouTube. No ads, no video - save time, save bandwidth

YouMuse is a webapp that allows you to play music from YouTube without a hassle.
Just search for a video, choose a result, and play! Playlists and settings are
saved so that you can bookmark and share URLs as playlists. YouMuse streams only
audio (and straight from YouTube servers) so it's fast and efficient.
